        <h1>Suggested precautions for those under COVID-19 home quarantine/lockdown</h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>When we need to step out of the house for obtaining key essentials, the following are the recommended steps: Make a list of what is likely to be required for the whole week: Vegetables, medicines, milk, bread, etc. Put down on the list alternatives/plan
        B. For instance, if fresh milk is not available, get Tetra-Pack milk or even milk powder. Minimize the number of times you need to step out of the house. Know your neighborhood facilities that are open and/deliver to your home. For instance, Big
        Bazaar has publicized phone number of their home delivery service, their locations, and what they will/will not deliver. If your needs can be ordered for delivery do not step out. When items are delivered to you. When the delivery person rings
        your doorbell, explains to him, and ensures distance of 1 m between you. Do not allow him/her to enter your home. Let him leave delivery package on the floor. Most times, you have only to give OTP to him verbally. If signature is required, use
        your own pen. Avoid unnecessary touching of paper or anything else. Use the buddy system, if there is someone else at home with you. Using a dedicated scissor, cut open outer package. Ask your buddy to take out inner packing without touching the
        outer package. Let him bring the inner package into the house. Dispose off or store the outer package outside the home. Step back inside the home and store scissors inside your outside shopping bag. Call your buddy to close and lock the door.
        Immediately go to the bathroom and thoroughly wash your hands and face before touching anything and anyone. Drink a mug of hot beverage – tea/coffee/water. For items where you need to step out. Find out which neighborhood shops are open and their
        timings. Phone the shop, your neighbors, or even the society watchman. Only one adult from the family should go out. This adult should be fit and preferably younger than 60 years. No giving company. There should be no requirement of assistance
        in carrying the goods. Use a wheeled bag/carry-on bag if necessary. Plan the route – remember to spend as little time outside the house as possible. If possible, phone the shop in advance and share your list. Let them pack and keep bill ready.
        Plan route to limit bumping into others. Dress appropriately. Use a full sleeve shirt, full pants, full-length dress, closed shoes, and cap. Wear a mask if comfortable in it. Remember not to touch/adjust it unnecessarily. Avoid using a wallet.
        Take limited currency, credit/debit card, coins, and one government-issued photo ID. Place them safely inside your shopping bag – in a disposable envelope, if possible. (On return to home keep the shopping bag, envelope, and its contents separately).
        Inform family when you are going out and what time you are expected to return. If someone else is at home, do not carry home keys with you. It is expected that essentials on your list will be available within walking distance. If not, use your
        vehicle. Use the same vehicle and key each time. Avoid the use of public transport as much as possible. If taking a mobile phone, also use earphones (Bluetooth/ cordless preferred) so that you do not need keep touching the phone. Keep the social
        distance of at least one meter. No gossiping. No handshaking. Use traditional Namaste. Be careful not to touch or brush against anything – especially those that are touched by multiple people (door handles, lift buttons, and doorbells). Use your
        non-dominant hand (the left hand for right- handers and vice versa) for touching things that cannot be avoided. Use elbow or forearm or foot to open door or push buttons. There is less risk of accidentally touching eyes, nose, and mouth by your
        non-dominant hands. On returning home: Press bell with an elbow. Wait for the door to be opened from inside – without touching it. All items taken out (mask, wallet, bags, and keys) should be kept separately near the main door. Remove footwear
        near the door and keep separately Let someone else/buddy (who is already inside the home) close and lock the main door. Immediately go to the bathroom and thoroughly wash your hands, face, and feet before touching anything and anyone. Change your
        clothes. Clothes used for the trip should be directly put inside the washing machine and washed separately from other clothes. Take steam inhalation for 5 min – remember COVID-19 is a respiratory virus and enters through mouth and nose. Take a
        bath. Drink cup of hot liquid – tea coffee/water. Be sensible. Be cautious. Be careful. Although we might not be able to totally #AVOID exposure, we certainly CAN #REDUCE it.

        <h1>GUIDELINES FOR HOME QUARANTINE
        </h1>
    </marquee>

    <p>
        The Guideline for Home quarantine / Quarantine in non-health care settings is intended for anyone who believes they have been exposed to COVID-19 and are required to be home quarantined to prevent community transmission. 1. Allocate a separate room with
        adequate ventilation at home if possible. Household members should stay in another room or should be separated from the returnee. 2. Maintain at least one meter distance from family members. 3. Other household members should use a separate bathroom.
        If sharing the same bathroom, cleaning of taps, doorknobs and utensils with soap and water are a requirement. 4. Minimize visitors to the house, the returnee should not interact with any visitors 5. Frequent hand washing with soap and water for
        at least 20 seconds at a time and maintain alcohol based hand hygiene in instances where hand washing facilities are inadequate 6. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hand 7. The home quarantined person is expected to monitor body
        temperature using a thermometer twice a day. If he/she develops fever , cough, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, body aches and pain, including flu like symptoms, immediately inform MOH / PHI of the area 8. After use, disposable facemasks
        and gloves should be properly discarded without reuse, preferably in a closed container 9. Assign separate dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, and other items for the quarantined person 10. Used utensils, bed linen
        and clothes should be washed with soap and water

        <h1> Covid Information </h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>

        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as the coronavirus, or COVID, is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The
        disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8] Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever,[9] cough, headache,[10] fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[11][12] Symptoms may begin
        one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[13] Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to
        moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[14] Older people
        are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[15] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate
        the long-term effects of the disease.[15] Transmission of COVID-19 occurs when people are exposed to virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person.[16][17] Those particles may be inhaled or may reach
        the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person through touching or direct deposition (i.e. being coughed on).[16] The risk of infection is highest when people are in close proximity for a long time, but particles can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly
        indoors in poorly ventilated and crowded spaces.[16][18] In those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[16] Touching a contaminated surface or object may lead to infection although this does not contribute
        substantially to transmission.[16][19] People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms.[20][21] People remain infectious for up
        to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to twenty days in severe cases.[22] Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid
        by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Preventive measures include
        physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to
        minimize the risk of transmissions. Several vaccines have been developed and many countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management
        involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

        <h1>Prevention </h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>
        Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[128]
        washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[129][130] Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be
        infected are advised by the CDC to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover
        coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[131][132] The first COVID-19 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 December by the UK medicines regulator MHRA.[133]
        It was evaluated for emergency use authorization (EUA) status by the US FDA, and in several other countries.[134] Initially, the US National Institutes of Health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of COVID-19, before or
        after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[135][136] Without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak,
        known as "flattening the curve".[137] This is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments
        or a vaccine become available.

        <h1>Social distancing</h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>

        Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools,
        workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[4]
        Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.[168] Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[169][170] In the United States,
        the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.

        <h1>Self-isolation</h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>
        Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected. Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[183] Many governments have mandated or recommended
        self-quarantine for entire populations. The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[184] Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country
        or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.

        <h1>Immunity</h1>
    </marquee>
    <p>

        The immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[258] just as with most other infections.[259] Since SARS-CoV-2 has been in the human population only since December 2019, it remains
        unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.[260] The presence of neutralizing antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralizing antibody declines with time.
        Those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody two months after infection. In another study, the level of neutralizing antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. However,
        the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Memory B cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 last for at least six months after the appearance
        of symptoms.[260] Nevertheless, 15 cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported using stringent CDC criteria requiring identification of a different variant from the second infection. There are likely to be many more people who have
        been reinfected with the virus. Herd immunity will not eliminate the virus if reinfection is common.[260] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[261] Nonetheless, on 3 March 2021, scientists
        reported that a much more contagious COVID-19 variant, Lineage P.1, first detected in Japan, and subsequently found in Brazil, as well as in several places in the United States, may be associated with COVID-19 disease reinfection after recovery
        from an earlier COVID-19 infection.

            </marquee>
            <p>
                Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The further away, the better. Make wearing
                a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible. Here are the basics of how to wear a mask: Clean your hands before you put your
                mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time. Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin. When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s
                a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin. Dont use masks with valves. For specifics on what type of mask to wear and when, read our Q&A and watch our videos. There is also a Q&A focused on masks and children. Find out
                more about the science of how COVID-19 infects people and our bodies react by watching or reading this interview. For specific advice for decision makers, see WHO technical guidance.

                    <h4>How to make your environment safer</h4>
                </marquee>
                Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact. Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices and places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings
                where they talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing. The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected people spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments
                are where the virus appears to spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more important. Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces
                are small and without outdoor air coming in. For more information on how to hold events like family gatherings, childrens football games and family occasions, read our Q&A on small public gatherings. Avoid crowded or indoor settings but
                if you cant, then take precautions: Open a window. Increase the amount of ‘natural ventilation’ when indoors. WHO has published Q&As on ventilation and air conditioning for both the general public and people who manage public spaces and
                buildings. Wear a mask (see above for more details).

                    <h4> Dont forget the basics of good hygiene</h4>
                </marquee>
                Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick
                up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                dispose of the used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following good ‘respiratory hygiene’, you protect the people around you from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19. Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently
                especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens.

                </marquee>
                Know the full range of symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include loss of taste or smell, aches and pains, headache, sore throat,
                nasal congestion, red eyes, diarrhoea, or a skin rash. Stay home and self-isolate even if you have minor symptoms such as cough, headache, mild fever, until you recover. Call your health care provider or hotline for advice. Have someone
                bring you supplies. If you need to leave your house or have someone near you, wear a medical mask to avoid infecting others. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by telephone first,
                if you can and follow the directions of your local health authority. Keep up to date on the latest information from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national health authorities. Local and national authorities and public health
                units are best placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to protect themselves.
